<p>Dear {{name}},</p>

 <p style="color:blue; font-style: italic;" >
Attached is my cash offer for 5541 NW 174TH DR in MIAMI. I'm a rehabber looking for inventory. I'll make offers on any of your distressed or problem listings. I like properties that need work. I don't have an agent for this transaction so all the commission is yours :- )
</p>

<p>
