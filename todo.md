when i click on email icon in the controller it gets all resources and pass it to the -> server controller, 
? where is it getting it ?

Waterfall to 

a. create the email Html temmplate like in  users.passworkd.server.controller. 
b. Send the email  - 
c. Upon sending the email - save some changes in the database like what time email was sent. 
up th ecounter for how many emils were sent. 


2)
Inside server-controller grab all the properties, 
here you have the 
agentName,
agentEmail, 
propertyaddress, 
propertyCity, etc


3) 
here it using lodash it sends the email to them.  Send the email to them..
